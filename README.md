**Tutorial 1**: Setting up the Conda Environment and Matrix Operations using Numpy. 

**Tutorial 2**: Learning Pandas Dataframes and Linear Regression. also using Matplotlib for plotting.

**Data:** 
**CommunitiesandCrime**: Download this dataset where your ML Lab notebooks are saved for Tutorial 2.

**Tutorial 3**: Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression using Scikit-Learn on the Communities and crime Dataset from Tutorial 2.

**Tutorial 4 and Tutorial 5** : Using Heart Disease Dataset for EDA, ridge regression, kernel regression and logistic regression.
